Glenthorne National Park ‚Äî Ityamaiitpinna Yarta,5,"We visited Glenthorne on a whim, after driving around and randomly exploring Adelaide and its surrounds.

We had no idea what to expect so went in blind, but ended up loving the hour or so we spent there. The park proudly embraces indigenous culture, informs and educates about the local flora and fauna, and contains an awesome playground/BBQ area for families and kids, as well as offering walking tracks through the grounds.

Usually, when I see the very typical dry and barren Aussie grasslands, I'm not too enthused. On this occasion, however, being in the midst of it and away from society (to a reasonable extent, anyway), it was surprisingly peaceful and serene. I could have sat on a rock for hours, just watching the birds and enjoying the sunshine.

The playground is truly one-of-a-kind and would have been a regular haunt had my kids grown up in the area. Everything is a clever blend of steel and timber, giving it a very colonial, 'this belongs here' feel. I was very impressed. For the parents, there's some covered seating, clean toilets, and the aforementioned BBQs. And, should seating be limited on a busy day, the ample shady trees can help you out.

Overall, Glenthorne NP was a lucky find. It gave us an unexpected detox from the hustle-and-bustle, and I say that with a certain level of mirth, considering we were in Adelaide enjoying a holiday! Nevertheless, peace and quiet is always a good thing, as is swapping people for animals, now and again. Glenthorne is a lovely spot, please see it for yourself when the timing and weather suits.",True

Sturt Gorge River Trail Trailhead,5,"These trails are excellent for both hiking and mountain biking, offering an enjoyable experience even on winter days when snakes aren't a concern. You have the option to stay along the river or explore the uphill paths. The sound of kookaburras laughing adds to the charm, and there's a wide variety of birds to observe.",True
Sturt Gorge River Trail Trailhead,5,Hands down the best creek trail ever.  It is a trail that is rough around the edges and caution is needed in certain areas that are hard to navigate.  To do the full length of the creek trail crossings of the creek are essential and when the creek is full and flowing you will get your feet a bit wet. Great for the healthy don't need to be super fit.,True

Kambah Centenary Trail,5,Yeah look nice trail it was rather tranquil and very easy terrain. Saw a giant grey kangaroo lurking in the shadow of a gum tree and a few wallabies. If you go long enough you‚Äôll get to red rock gorge lookout. Quite a beautiful scenic lookout and well worth the walk!,True
Kambah Centenary Trail,5,"I've never seen the river and feeder creeks so high and the water flow so fast as it was this week.

Elouera Bushland Natural Park,5,"Beautiful walk, parked easily on Martens (I think?) street & the entrance was right there. Paved paths as points, some points were a bit slippery and muddy. Connects to part of the Great Northern Walk & you can also visit the Quarry Lookout. Nice trail, very quiet.",True
Elouera Bushland Natural Park,5,"Here the second segment of the Great North Walk (Berowra Valley National Park) starts.

I did Thornleigh --> Hornsby Heights 21km 7h45 (moving time 6h45), challenging.

When you reach the Fishpond Lookout, I suggest you keep going on the former Great North to reach the Fishpond; then go back and follow the deviation to Manor Rd.

The trail is well maintained and marked but it is a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù path so full of rocks and roots. You should use a trail app to be sure you're on the right way.

I found the most uneven path on my way down (pretty steep especially on the way down in Galston Gorge with a few climbing spikes as well; instead, the ways up have mainly proper steps) so I guess you should choose the route according to this.

The first segment of the way out in Hornsby Heights is not an official path and is not signaled so keep an eye on your map; however after about 300m it becomes a fire trail easy to follow.

The 596 bus brings you to the train station.

No toilets and no drinking water on the whole way.

I‚Äôm not an expert hiker and not even a sportive person but I did it, so I guess the trail is for everyone.",True

Walk past the little Creek and follow the track to the Zig Zag bridge.

Go up the steep slope and you'll see the Quarry on the right. If you are adventurous, you can climb up the steep cliff around the quarry. Otherwise go up the flight of stairs further down past the quarry.

The views of reflection of the city on the water is amazing and the golden hour hits different. The bushes, palm trees and the ducks adds all the difference and is very relaxing and peaceful. If I lived in Melbourne I would have taken the walk everyday. Not to mention the sound of the birds above the trees is awesome and is a natural heaven. It is much much much recommended.

So far I've come back twice and still haven't explored nearly even half of the available tracks. I usually start near Grays Point public school, and there's usually plenty of car spots there, so parking is not hard. Some tracks can be easy, some can be more challenging, I think there's one that suits everyone. But unlike in the Blue Mountains for example, this one don't have the information board to help you choose the tracks on-site, so you have to research a bit using your phone (Google Maps).",True

Florence Parade Trail,5,"My absolute favourite local trail run or walk when I lived in the area.  Highly recommended midweek daytime to have the entire trail to yourself.

Not even a Telstra signal from just after Engadine until half way up Honeymoon (going anticlockwise), have a survival strategy - you can run without water and first aid but not recommended for most people.  Wear safety specs if running through the tight Engadine - Audley section, check for bush fires.  Both directions have benefits so I alternate.

White Ranch Park East Trailhead,5,"Fun and challenging place for a hike or bike ride, with beautiful views and plenty of trail!  The climb up to the West trailhead is aggressive and rocky in parts, but well worth the trip back down, especially by mountain bike!  Caution, the trails are not for the faint of heart or for cheap bikes...  the bike-only trail has plenty of technical rock challenges, several significant trail drops, and lots of banking - bring good brakes and a snug helmet!!",True
White Ranch Park East Trailhead,4,"For biking, there is a very steep climb from the lower lot to the best trails. I'd recommend this lot for advanced riders as the easier trails can better be accessed from the upper lots. For me Longhorn is worth the climb (but not too often ;)",False
White Ranch Park East Trailhead,1,"This is terrible for hiking. I mean that. It's absolutely hateful each step.
As you see it's beautiful location.
But there are hundreds of bikes on the trail, every 20/30 seconds someone is jumping hoping, translating and switching gears, breathless near you.
Some parts are so tide that I didn't feel safe at all.
This is definitely for üö≤ ONLY. The very few hiker's like me must breathe the dust that the competition boy's on üö≤ create.
There is no connection to the nature.
It's impossible to hike or enjoy anything there. It's busier than time's square.
I wish someone was more blunt about how not hike is that trail.
Also is forbidden to walk outside of the trail because Is private property.
I did went inside the forest near by, to relax.
For hiking is very stressful and not recommended.
I would not go there again. Do not recommend.",False

You can put together a nice loop that will have lots of ups and downs and very nice views of the plains and the Denver metro area. I would note, though, that views take a bit of uphill climbing. However, the trailhead/parking lot is at the lowest elevation of the whole park, so the last part of your adventure will be downhill. Enjoy!",True

Great choice for the day.",True

Ralston Creek Trail,4,"I biked the entirety of the trail (out and back) which was about 26 miles round trip.  There is a slight elevation gain of around 250 feet, so fairly level with a few steep inclines as you approach Tucker Lake and Blunn Reservoir.  The trail takes you through several, well maintained city parks and through a nice golf course.  There is also a very cool pedestrian bridge at the end of the trail located at Gold Strike Park.  The trail can be difficult to follow at times as it forces you to jump on the street for several blocks before you reconnect to the trail.  Keep an eye for signs directing back to the trail.

Overall, this was a nice ride.  It wasn't too busy which made social distancing very manageable.",False

East Plum Creek Trail - Meadows Trailhead and Parking,5,"I have regularly biked and walked on the East Plum Creek Trail for many years and really enjoy the scenery and wildlife I have seen, including: deer, beaver, snakes, coyotes, and a large assortment of birds. But today my focus was a little different. Recently, I read an article in the National Geographic about a photographer who takes pictures of tree bark from around the world. That gave me an idea. During my walk today on the East Plum Creek Trail I decided to see what the bark of various trees had to offer and was truly surprised by what I saw. All of the photos attached to this review were taken within a very short distance: less than 30 yards. Based on what I saw today, I intend for this to be an ongoing project.",True

We are new to Colorado and hiking and although we were out of breath most of the hike, it was fairly easy physically, so I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not too bad for beginners!

Palmer Park Trail CaveOutlook,5,"Update: I came here for the second time to try to find the ‚Äúcave outlook‚Äù but could not find the trail to take me and my friend there. Again gorgeous views, peaceful and quiet. The trail does get fairly hot because there‚Äôs not a lot of shade and lots of rock. We followed the templeton trail off of the Eden trail and I would say it‚Äôs an intermediate to advanced hike as it was steep in some areas with some downhills as well. A handful of bicycles, trail runners, and hikers. Not suitable for strollers. With everything said, this is one of the most nature filled, most gorgeous hikes, with intermediate/advanced trail options in the Colorado Springs area.

Overall I do recommend and loved this hiking area :)

We were told there were also hiking trails.  On the day we went (Saturday sfternoon), parking was tight but there were spaces across the road from the Park.
