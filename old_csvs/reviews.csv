There's plenty of breathtaking views up and down and the water filling the pools after the rain makes for a refreshing dip in some spots",True

Temptation Creek Trail,5,"I did the loop that goes from 159 Farnell Avenue, via Loftus Loop Track and Temptation Creek. The trail was amazing! You can even walk all the way up to the waterfall. Once you get all the way down, just before you start the ascent there is a stream of water that goes in the middle of the path. If you're coming through the Loftus Loop track side, before you cross this stream, on your right is a small opening that leads upwards. Follow this trail up and you will be able to see the little waterfall. Quite the view!! If it had rained the previous couple of days, the track can be pretty boggy so I highly suggest wearing waterproof boots if this is the case.",True
Temptation Creek Trail,5,"Love this trail. Depending on which turns you make, you can make your walk as short or as long as you like.",True
Xanthorrhoea Trail,5,"As usual this is an unmarked trail. Definitely download the map because there are multiple places where paths overlap and you will probably get horribly lost.
Despite that, this is probably one of the best near-Perth walks to do. It has some very steep sections at the start and finish to really test you, and gentle and moderate sections. Most of the time the paths are very easy to follow, although there are a few narrow parts. Given the recent rain the paths are muddy in places, but not terrible. Water is flowing in all the gullies and creeks, which provides a beautiful soundscape, as do the many different bird songs. The views across the flood plain to Perth are glorious as are the views to the hills.
If you enjoy being challenged without being smashed, this is a great walk.",True

I saw a lot of dogs here- easy to take on a short trail but much harder when you get to the steeper rockier sections- you might have to carry them!

Logan Village to Yarrabilba Rail Trail,5,"I hear people's concerns around the track running off the back of homes and retirement villages. With all due respect to all we must not feed into fear as that is sin in itself. Be rest assured that rail trails are a good thing for the future public's health/ fitness and will have to be built with a lot of safety ground's in mind with the rail trail project, natural bushland and wildlife habitat respected and in mind and the safety of already long-term living residence around the area. If I may suggest for all retirement homes if there could be extra camera's and security put in place to help the residents feel more at peace of mind with the project and maybe if there was a large sound proof block out wall to reduce some of the size of the project and noise to help settle residence nerves may be a thought to consider. Health, family, get-togethers, fresh air, and peace of mind all can be brought together as one in this big. I myself would love to see the rail trail go ahead for a better tomorrow and healthy future. Not building these projects due to people's fears is not the answer to fixing a fast growing problem in our society nor world. It is punishing our future Young youth that want to give it a go.",True

Basin Trail,2,"The Basin Trail is a pretty awful track for walking - it's basically a 4WD track down to the Basin camping area, and the steepest part at the end is concrete.

Well worth the effort walking the track. There is lush vegetation along the creek and gnarly trees growing from heavily folded metamorphic rocks at the top. There are wild orchids growing close to copses of flame heath and insect eating plants on shady slopes. Every turn of the path reveals a different view.

Great for the healthy don't need to be super fit.,True

Elouera Bushland Natural Park,5,"Here the second segment of the Great North Walk (Berowra Valley National Park) starts.

I did Thornleigh --> Hornsby Heights 21km 7h45 (moving time 6h45), challenging.

When you reach the Fishpond Lookout, I suggest you keep going on the former Great North to reach the Fishpond; then go back and follow the deviation to Manor Rd.

The trail is well maintained and marked but it is a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù path so full of rocks and roots. You should use a trail app to be sure you're on the right way.

I found the most uneven path on my way down (pretty steep especially on the way down in Galston Gorge with a few climbing spikes as well; instead, the ways up have mainly proper steps) so I guess you should choose the route according to this.

The first segment of the way out in Hornsby Heights is not an official path and is not signaled so keep an eye on your map; however after about 300m it becomes a fire trail easy to follow.

The 596 bus brings you to the train station.

No toilets and no drinking water on the whole way.

Walk past the little Creek and follow the track to the Zig Zag bridge.

Go up the steep slope and you'll see the Quarry on the right. If you are adventurous, you can climb up the steep cliff around the quarry. Otherwise go up the flight of stairs further down past the quarry.

If I lived in Melbourne I would have taken the walk everyday. Not to mention the sound of the birds above the trees is awesome and is a natural heaven. It is much much much recommended. You can also take your bike for a ride around the pond. Across the road you can see the golf field which also looks amazing and rich.",True

So far I've come back twice and still haven't explored nearly even half of the available tracks. I usually start near Grays Point public school, and there's usually plenty of car spots there, so parking is not hard. Some tracks can be easy, some can be more challenging, I think there's one that suits everyone.

Not even a Telstra signal from just after Engadine until half way up Honeymoon (going anticlockwise), have a survival strategy - you can run without water and first aid but not recommended for most people.  Wear safety specs if running through the tight Engadine - Audley section, check for bush fires.  Both directions have benefits so I alternate.

Firstly, the creek seemed very dry and dead.
Secondly, it is hard to find restrooms nearby.

Glenthorne National Park ‚Äî Ityamaiitpinna Yarta,5,"We visited Glenthorne on a whim, after driving around and randomly exploring Adelaide and its surrounds.

We had no idea what to expect so went in blind, but ended up loving the hour or so we spent there. The park proudly embraces indigenous culture, informs and educates about the local flora and fauna, and contains an awesome playground/BBQ area for families and kids, as well as offering walking tracks through the grounds.

Usually, when I see the very typical dry and barren Aussie grasslands, I'm not too enthused. On this occasion, however, being in the midst of it and away from society (to a reasonable extent, anyway), it was surprisingly peaceful and serene. I could have sat on a rock for hours, just watching the birds and enjoying the sunshine.

The playground is truly one-of-a-kind and would have been a regular haunt had my kids grown up in the area. Everything is a clever blend of steel and timber, giving it a very colonial, 'this belongs here' feel. I was very impressed. For the parents, there's some covered seating, clean toilets, and the aforementioned BBQs. And, should seating be limited on a busy day, the ample shady trees can help you out.

Overall, Glenthorne NP was a lucky find. It gave us an unexpected detox from the hustle-and-bustle, and I say that with a certain level of mirth, considering we were in Adelaide enjoying a holiday! Nevertheless, peace and quiet is always a good thing, as is swapping people for animals, now and again. Glenthorne is a lovely spot, please see it for yourself when the timing and weather suits.",True

Glen Stewart Park,5,"Nestled in the heart of nature‚Äôs embrace, Glen Stewart Park is a breathtaking escape from the bustling city life. My visits throughout the seasons have allowed me to capture its ever-changing yet always enchanting beauty.

In the warmth of summer, the lush canopy of leaves provides a verdant backdrop to the winding trails and the wooden bridge that serves as a charming gateway to tranquility. The sunlight filters through the branches, painting patterns of light and shadow that dance upon the path.

As autumn arrives, the park dons a golden cloak. The crisp air carries the rustle of fallen leaves, and the forest floor becomes a carpet of amber hues. The stark, bare branches of winter reveal the park's stoic grace under a blanket of snow, transforming the landscape into a monochrome masterpiece. The bridge, now dusted with snow, stands as a steadfast sentinel overseeing the quiet stillness.

Come spring, a chorus of birdsong heralds the rebirth of the park. Buds peek through the branches, and the gentle flow of the stream sings a melody of renewal.

For those seeking a momentary retreat or a peaceful hike, Glen Stewart Park is not just a destination; it‚Äôs an experience that lingers in the heart long after one's footsteps have left its grounds.",True

Weir Gulch Park,4,I've lived by this place my whole life and this park is really extensive and fun to bring the kids for a bike ride. this is a really good park if you want to explore or if you just want to play basketball or use a playground because if you follow the creek westwards from I-25 you will stumble on many different playgrounds and picnic areas that are perfect for spending more time with your family.,False

Trading Post Trail,4,Nice quick trail about 1.5 miles long and mostly flat with just a big hill at the end.

Free parking at the trading post building was nice!,False

Trading Post Trail,5,"A very good trail located on the Red Rocks Park and Amphitheater grounds. Approximately 1.5 Mi long, but you gain almost 400 ft in elevation. Parts of the trail are actually flat steps (pic) that can be rather slippery if you're not paying attention- and especially on your way down as you might be moving faster. Just be careful and you'll be fine. My wife and I are 69 years old when we did this trail 4 weeks ago and we did just fine. The scenery and wildlife in the area is just spectacular.",True
Trading Post Trail,5,"Appropriate that we had to wander around out there seeing Lord Huron at Red Rocks.  Steep, but beautiful.  Even at night.",True

Daniels Gate Trail Parking,5,This is definitely a great little hike for the family and pets. While it is heavily trafficked it still offers an escape and quick exercise.

Daniels Gate Trail Parking,5,"Beautiful park to run, bike, hike, etc. Not much shade though. Main Trail seems to be stroller friendly as well. Mostly rolling hills for about 4 miles through the park. A few places to park inside the park and on the outskirts of the park. Beautiful scenery!",True

Fox Run Regional Park,5,I always love to come here regardless of the time of year. Have been coming here for almost 20 years now. It‚Äôs a nice large park with a couple small pounds to walk around. The perimeter of the park is just about a 5k and is what I use to as a running area. There is always plenty of parking and room to be alone in the ‚Äúwoods‚Äù. Everyone should come check this place out! Defently recommend bring you hammock.,True
Fox Run Regional Park,5,"Great park. We took a group of 72 students/leaders here to enjoy a lunch break and we all really enjoyed it. We were in town from Texas to attend the awesome, life-changing Desperation Conference at New Life Church. It was a bummer that the volleyball nets weren't available and only porta potties for restrooms.",True
Fox Run Regional Park,3,"The park was very nice.  We were there for a wedding ceremony in the wedding gazebo and then the reception in a different area. The park gave no indication, via signs,  of where anything could be located.  Guests drove around searching for the gazebo then again to find the reception with numbers marking gathering sites in no particular order.
The plan was to dress for the wedding, then to change into casual clothing for outdoor games, etc. The large bathrooms were all locked, in the middle of June!! The only option was to use the porta-potty! That is not ever a good option, and even worse when one is all dressed up. Everything would have been much smoother with available bathroom availability.",False
Fox Run Regional Park,5,"Great, big park with wide open spaces and clean places!
Beautifully maintained area with an updated playground that has fun colors and safe low-to-the-ground features, has gazebos, even a wedding gazebo, picnic pavilions with tables that are kept clean, dog park, horseback riding, volleyball, 4 miles of hiking trails, a horseshoe pit, water fountains and big, clean restrooms, But beware of the compostable toilets they have as anything that goes down, will not be easily retrieved!!
All facilities are able to be reserved. We enjoyed the park during a company picnic where a petting zoo was able to be brought in, a bounce house, food vendor, corn hole set up and made use of the volleyball set up.
Plenty of parking and good signage for figuring out which pavilion you need to go to or other attractions you may be trying to get to as you enter the park.
Lots of rolling hills and healthy trees that provide natural shade. Nice open fields for playing catch, football, or soccer. For dogs, the grass is well maintained and dog park is kept clean.
We look forward to going back and spending more time there and enjoying the pavilions with water features.",True
Fox Run Regional Park,5,"Recently renovated ( last year or so -ish ), great for anything you want to do outsideAlways great.

Clear Creek Trail,5,"This is a highly recommended trail. It is comfortably organized so it does not get too busy (especially early in the morning), there are shaded spots, and the maintenance is fabulous. Along the trail there are spots for tubing, carefully going into the water or just quietly sitting by them. The golden history park situated by the trail is also very interesting and highly recommended. The trail is right downtown so you can enjoy nature and find a good place to eat right thereafter.",True
Clear Creek Trail,5,"One of the main attractions for Golden. Plenty of sport and fun to be found in and around the creek off this trail. Or just a beautiful walk no matter the season.

If you walk the north side you can get to many of the main places in Golden: Parfet park, lions park, the library, the tennis courts, the baseball fields, RV/camping park, and a lot of Golden history including the Golden History Museum.

If you like to bike, the south side of the trail is for you. Not too bad of a ride.",True

Sondermann Park,5,"The locals call it the Enchanted Forest. It's truly a place full of magic. Walking through at night is a whole different experience. At twilight, you will see strange small lights along the path and in the trees. The wildlife is most active at night.

There are two trees that produce edible fruits and so far I've found one bush with raspberries that are in bloom during spring.",True

Probably the best part about living in Colorado is that you get the opportunity to experience these kind of natural experiences.",True
Big dry creek trail,5,"I absolutely love taking my dog on walks here! They're constantly upgrading/improving the area to be more user friendly and safe. It's along The Big Dry Creek Trail, so it's a constant battle for space between parks and rec vs. the homeless population that live along there and it's one of the few areas that parks and rec is able to take a win.

Runyon Canyon Park,5,"A very interesting and completely free park that goes all the way from Fuller Avenue and Vista Street up to Mulholland Drive. You can either choose to walk up from from street level via Hollywood or drive up to the entrance at the top via Mulholland.

There is a major pathway that‚Äôs paved with concrete, but there are also numerous side trails and ridge lines that split away. You can take all kinds of interesting routes to vista points and mountainside paths.

From the top part of the trail and it‚Äôs various points along canyons ridges you can most of Los Angeles. It‚Äôs a great and breathtaking view. Runyon Canyon has a lot to offer hikers of all fitness levels, and the sights are spectacular.

It‚Äôs a great getaway from the bustle of Los Angeles. You‚Äôre quite close to the city but you feel transported into nature and completely removed from the relentless busyness of the city.",True
Runyon Canyon Park,5,"Definitely recommend visiting here at sunset hour!

It‚Äôs not too far from Hollywood walk of fame. Around 20min walking. The vibes here are totally different from the busy Hollywood neighborhood. It can get a bit crowded for sure. But you‚Äôll also see more of local people coming here for a walk. If you take the path on the right after entering the park, you can get to the hillside where you can capture a good sight of Hollywood sign and Griffith Observatory. It might seem blurry form the pictures, but in real life they are definitely visible.

The sunset hour also makes the city view much more romantic. The sky would turn rosy. The temperature would also drop to a comfortable degree for hiking up and down the hills.

Prepare sneakers for sure. It can get quite steep. If not taking pictures, you can expect to finish the route in 1 hour if taking the loop facing Hollywood sign.",True
Runyon Canyon Park,5,"This park is the bomb! The views of the city are simply stunning, and of course, you can't miss that iconic Hollywood sign.

Now, let's talk about the trail. It's like a choose-your-own-adventure book, but instead of pages, you got two paths to pick from. Make sure you choose wisely, or you might end up in a real-life adventure ü§™",True
Runyon Canyon Park,5,"Quick easy hike up to a great view of the central LA region.
Parking along Fuller has a two hour limit, which is ideal for an easy paced hike through the main loop. The eastern trail up the hill is quicker to the view but a little more strenuous.
The western trail up and down towards the east will bring you to that view but will also provide that along your way back down (don't get distracted)
There is plenty of water provided throughout the trail, but there is almost no shade at all, so be ready for that.",True
Runyon Canyon Park,5,Came here on a Friday evening and it was quite sleepy and peaceful. Views were great and I did the trail going counter clockwise which is steep in the beginning but on the way down you can take the longer paved windy way.,True
Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve,5,"If I hadn't been enjoying San Diego so much already, Torrey Pines would have made it happen.

I thoroughly feel in love with this nature reserve. The beauty of the beach, the unique flora and Fauna, the scents and sounds... It was all perfectly beautiful and I can't wait to go back.

I think the only downside was the price of parking, but it was worth it to spend the day in such a stunning place.",True
Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve,5,"We visited Torrey Pines for the first time and it didn't disappoint! If you get there in the morning, there is plenty of parking available. Parking is $15 from Monday - Thursday and $20 from Friday - Sunday. You may park at the bottom or drive a bit further up the hill, depending on which trails you'll be exploring. We opted for the trails further up the hill and I recommend them 100%, especially the Beach trail, yucca point and razor point. There are plenty of bathrooms by the parking lot, as well as water stations to refill your bottles.",True

Palmer Park Trailhead,5,My go to spot. Always a great place to take the üê∂ for a hike for sure. She loves it here as much or more than I do. So much to explore.

Lots of dogs and people including mountain bikes on the trail. Very well maintained. Beware no water and very exposed throughout entire hike. Multiple places to stop and turn or complete smaller loops as desired. Bathroom facilities clean and no wait. Private with locks. Doggie doo bags available in the front of the hike. Great choice for the day.",True
Matthews / Winters Park,5,"One of my favorite trails in Jefferson County. From the parking lot take the trail up, stay to the right on Red Rocks Trail which merges with Morrison Slide Trail and you‚Äôll climb up to the ‚Äúsummit.‚Äù Great views of the front range, early morning on most weekdays is generally the best time to do this loop. The loop back to the parking area takes about an hour and a half.",True
Matthews / Winters Park,4,"Really nice hiking here. Trails are in very good shape (it‚Äôs October so everything is dry) A nice mix of uphill, downhill, some rock walking but most is dirt.  Go early though for parking. We were leaving at 9:30 and cars were waiting to take our space. There is a sign saying there was additional parking at _____.  Not sure where, but I did see a parking lot not too far down the road - but on the other side of the road.  It might be a bit tricky getting across.

Palmer Park Trail CaveOutlook,5,"Absolutely stunning views!! We are new to Colorado and hiking and although we were out of breath most of the hike, it was fairly easy physically, so I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not too bad for beginners! We found 3 caves but you had to go off trail a little and climb down some rocks to see them, don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs not any crazy rock climbing, I‚Äôm 41, not ‚ÄúFit‚Äù and I still made it, just make sure you have good shoes with good tread.

Palmer Park Trail CaveOutlook,5,"Update: I came here for the second time to try to find the ‚Äúcave outlook‚Äù but could not find the trail to take me and my friend there. Again gorgeous views, peaceful and quiet. The trail does get fairly hot because there‚Äôs not a lot of shade and lots of rock. We followed the templeton trail off of the Eden trail and I would say it‚Äôs an intermediate to advanced hike as it was steep in some areas with some downhills as well. A handful of bicycles, trail runners, and hikers. Not suitable for strollers. With everything said, this is one of the most nature filled, most gorgeous hikes, with intermediate/advanced trail options in the Colorado Springs area.

Overall I do recommend and loved this hiking area :)

Original review: Absolutely beautiful! Took my weinie dogs for a hike and they loved it. I got stung by a wasp just walking on the trail so be careful.

The views were still incredible and I definitely recommend the trails here!",True

Mount Falcon Park,5,"My husband and I hiked here before going to a concert at red rocks. The multi use trail was well maintained and challenging with the elevation change. All trail users were respectful of each other and it was fun to see red rocks from a distance and then a further distance as we hiked along. Beautiful area, hot in July but totally doable. Had breakfast at the nice picnic area before heading out and bathrooms were some of the cleanest and well maintained that we had encountered.",True

Mount Falcon Park,5,"Mount Falcon is a very interesting place.   Once owned by one of Denver's elite business men.  The remains of John Walker's house are at the top of the trail.   As well as the start of the foundation to what was supposed to be the White House of the West.
Starting at the Morrison parking lot, the trail will become an 8 mile roundtrip out and back hike.  Excellent views are afforded all around.  To the East is denver and down below to the North is red rocks amphitheater.  Once you get high enough, there is a lot of other peaks to see.
The trail does get more rocky at the top.   Hikers and bikers will be sharing this trail. There is a lot of sun exposure.   Very nice trail though for 3 or so hours.",True

Windy Saddle Park,5,"A favorite spot to watch the sunset. I haven‚Äôt done much hiking here other than the short and steep Mount Zion Trail. You don‚Äôt have to hike though to see epically beautiful views.

Park at the parking lot where the Beaver Brook Trailhead begins and that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll find these views right off the parking lot. Restrooms also available here.

Parking fills up in the evening. It‚Äôs a rather small lot. Alternatively, drive up to Lookout Mountain. There‚Äôs a large parking lot at the Buffalo Bill Museum and Grave with several easy viewpoints there too. All without hiking!",True
Windy Saddle Park,5,"For a hike this amazing so close to Denver it can only get 5 stars.

It is a deceiving trail which starts out gently up and no terrain problems. About 3/4 of a mile is where you‚Äôll encounter high 2 low 3 rock scrambling with moderate exposure (100-200 feet of drop)

The trail is easy to follow and well marked. Mostly tree covered (perfect for summer). Lovely vistas. Cool little streams. Pretty wildflowers and animals ( deer and elk)

Parking lot is tiny so get there early",True
Windy Saddle Park,5,One of my favorite hiking areas - though be warned the parking will be full by 8am on the weekends. Beaver Brooke trail connects and is such a fun hike with beautiful views and little elevation gain. There are some rock section scrambles to watch grandma on but nothing too wild. There are lots of bikers coming up the road to Lookout Mountain so just keep an eye on the drive. Great spot if you are looking for a moderate hike!,True

White Ranch Park East Trailhead,5,Beautiful hiking trails close to Denver. The trail wasn't overly crowded. Kid friendly and great for rockhounding.,True
White Ranch Park East Trailhead,5,"Fun and challenging place for a hike or bike ride, with beautiful views and plenty of trail!  The climb up to the West trailhead is aggressive and rocky in parts, but well worth the trip back down, especially by mountain bike!  Caution, the trails are not for the faint of heart or for cheap bikes...  the bike-only trail has plenty of technical rock challenges, several significant trail drops, and lots of banking - bring good brakes and a snug helmet!!",True
White Ranch Park East Trailhead,4,"For biking, there is a very steep climb from the lower lot to the best trails. I'd recommend this lot for advanced riders as the easier trails can better be accessed from the upper lots. For me Longhorn is worth the climb (but not too often ;)",False
White Ranch Park East Trailhead,1,"This is terrible for hiking. I mean that. It's absolutely hateful each step.
As you see it's beautiful location.
But there are hundreds of bikes on the trail, every 20/30 seconds someone is jumping hoping, translating and switching gears, breathless near you.
Some parts are so tide that I didn't feel safe at all.
This is definitely for üö≤ ONLY. The very few hiker's like me must breathe the dust that the competition boy's on üö≤ create.
There is no connection to the nature.
It's impossible to hike or enjoy anything there. It's busier than time's square.
I wish someone was more blunt about how not hike is that trail.
Also is forbidden to walk outside of the trail because Is private property.
I did went inside the forest near by, to relax.
For hiking is very stressful and not recommended.
I would not go there again. Do not recommend.",False
White Ranch Park East Trailhead,5,"Just pick up a map and start hiking (or biking) ! You can put together a nice loop that will have lots of ups and downs and very nice views of the plains and the Denver metro area. I would note, though, that views take a bit of uphill climbing.

Skinnarviksparken,5,"My absolute favourite place in Stockholm! The views from the top of the hill are simply breathtaking, whether you visit during the day or at night. However I would caution that it can be a bit difficult to navigate the park at night as the lighting is not very bright.

One thing to keep in mind is that the park can get quite busy, especially during peak times. The top of the hill doesn‚Äôt have much room, so it can feel a bit crowded at times. However, in my opinion, the stunning panoramic views more than make up for any potential crowds.

If you have mobility issues, I would suggest being careful as the park is quite rocky and can be very slippery in winter. Whilst it is accessible to some degree, it may not be the best option for everyone.

I highly recommend Skinnarviksparken for anyone visiting Stockholm. It‚Äôs a beautiful, serene escape from the hustle of the city, and the views are simply unforgettable.",True
